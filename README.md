# contact-manager
Stores your contacts for AmmyyAdmin, AnyDesk, Rustdesk, and allows you to call them from this application. No need to maintain separate databases for them anymore.
It would be good if you download these 3 programs to the root directory. AmmyyAdmin.exe AnyDesk.exe rustdesk.exe
The database is stored in csv with a comma as a separator. No encryption.
